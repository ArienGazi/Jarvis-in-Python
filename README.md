# Jarvis-in-Python
This project is a Python-based **voice assistant (Jarvis)** that uses speech recognition and text-to-speech to interact with users. It can search Wikipedia, open websites, play music, tell the time, launch apps, and send emails. Built with libraries like `pyttsx3`, `speechRecognition`, and `wikipedia`, it provides hands-free task automation.
